# Instant-Notify-Caller-Availability-System
Instant Notify is a hybrid Client–Server and Peer-to-Peer voice communication system designed to notify callers when a busy user becomes available. A central TCP server manages user registration, call signaling, and availability tracking, while real-time voice communication is handled through low-latency UDP-based P2P connections.
